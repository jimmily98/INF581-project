The Game Map
************

Each instance of Neural MMO contains an automatically generated tile-based game map of 128 x 128 tiles. The map is surrounded by Void. Agents that attempt to walk into the void dissapear, never to be seen again.

Tiles are broadly categorized as follows:
  - *Passable* tiles can be walked on while *obstacle* tiles block movement
  - *Resource* tiles can be harvested while *non-resource* cannot

Tiles in the game are classified based on their passability and whether they contain resources. Passable tiles could either have resources (Foliage, Ore, Tree, Crystal) or not (Grass, Harvested Tile). In contrast, obstacle tiles are non-passable and include resources like Water, Fish or non-resources like Stone, Void.

*Resource* tiles may be harvested. *Passable* tiles are harvested by walking over them and *non-passable* tiles by walking next to them. The resource is then consumed from the tile. It will regenerate randomly over time on the same tile. The only exception is the Water tile, which provides unlimited resource.

Visibility range is 7 tiles.

###############

Agents have health, food, and water. These are displayed overhead as green, gold, and blue bars respectively. Agents must stay full, hydrated, and healthy in order to survive. 

Losing and gaining resources:
  - Health, food, and water start at 100
  - Agents lose 5 food and 5 water per game tick
  - Agents lose 10 health per tick if out of food
  - Agents lose 10 health per tick if out of water
  - These values add - lose 20 health if out of food and water per tick
  - If above half food and half water, agents regain 10 health per tick

**Tick:** The gameplay consists of time units called “ticks.” When rendering, the game moves at 0.6s/tick.

Agents can replenish food and water. Walking on a foliage tile restores food to 100. The foliage tile then is harvested and will respawn at a random time in the same place. Walking adjacent to a water tile restores water to 100. Water tiles do not empty.

|icon| Competition Environment and Levels
*****************************************

At the start of a game, all agents on all teams spawn (enter the game) together around the perimeter of the map on the same tile. Agent teams are evenly dispersed around the perimeter. 

Non-Player Characters (NPCs) are any agent not controlled by a user; sometimes called a *mob*. NPCs are scattered across the entire map. They get stronger and more aggressive towards the center. NPCs are all individuals; they fight each other as well; and they are all controlled by basic scripts. Their aggression and strength levels are correlated, but otherwise are identical. 

Agents can occupy the same tile as other agents. There is no limit to number or type of agents on a single tile, including enemy agents and NPCs. 

**Time and Gameplay**
Each tick provides the opportunity for every Agent and NPC to do any, all or none of the following actions:

**Move 1 tile in any available direction**

- Agents cannot move off of the game space, or **into water.** 
- As the game progresses, the action space becomes constrained as a fog encircles the board. Agents cannot be in tiles covered in fog, and all gradually move towards the center of the game space.

**Attack an Agent - either NPC or from another team**

- Attack can only be against one other Agent or NPC
- To attack, your Agent must be within three tiles of the opponent (within a 7x7 square around your Agent).
 
**Inventory Management**

Inventory capacity is 12 items, including armor, weapon, tools, and consumables.

- Buy or Sell in the Market
- Destroy an item if no market value
- **Giving an item to a team mate is only permitted when standing on the same tile**

.. dropdown:: About the Action Space

   Each agent may take multiple actions per tick -- one from each category. Each action accepts a list of arguments. Each argument is a discrete variable. This can be either a standard index (i.e. 0-4 for direction) or a pointer to an entity (i.e. inventory item or agent).

About Combat
************

Each agent can attack one opponent per game tick. In a given tick, multiple enemy agents can attack a single agent. Agents select from Melee, Range, and Mage style attacks. An agent's main combat skill is the one that they use the most / have the highest level in. This is denoted by the hat they are wearing.

Attack skills obey a rock-paper-scissors dominance relationship: 
 - Melee beats Range 
 - Range beats Mage 
 - Mage beats Melee

Attack range is 3 tiles, full sweep view.

**Insert Image**

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Choosing attack style
    
        The attacker can select the skill strongest against the target's main skill. This multiplies the effectiveness of the attack. However, the defender can immediately retaliate in the same way. A strong agent with a higher level and better equipment can still beat a weaker agent, even if the weaker agent uses the attack style that multiplies damage. 

    .. tab-item:: Armor
    
        There are three pieces of armor: Hat, Top, Bottom. Armor requires at least one skill ≥ the item level to equip. Armor provides defense that increases with equipment level.

    .. tab-item:: Weapons and Tools
    
        Weapons require an associated fighting style skill level ≥ the item level to equip. Weapons boost attacks; higher level weapons provide more boost. Tools grant a flat defense regardless of item level.

**Damage** to health is a randomized function based on several factors, including:
 - Fighting style
 - Combat skill level
 - Weapon level
 - Armor levels

.. code-block:: python

   def COMBAT_DAMAGE_FORMULA(self, offense, defense, multiplier):
      '''Damage formula'''
      return int(multiplier * (offense * (15 / (15 + defense))))


Professions, Tools, and Items
*****************************

There are 8 Professions that Agents can learn and level up in. Agents can improve their skills in multiple Professions, but will not be able to progress in all Professions. How Professions are distributed across Agent teams is a part of game strategy. 

For Skills Prospecting, Carving, and Alchemy, agents walk on the associated resource tile to harvest the resource. Agent receives a different quality/level of resource, depending on agent levels/tools. The resource tile will respawn later in the same place. There is a 2.5 percent chance to obtain a weapon while gathering ammunition on a tile.

**Agents have an inventory that can hold 12 items.**

Game items are categorized based on their application in combat or gathering. For combat, professions like Mage, Melee, and Range use tools such as Wand, Sword, and Bow respectively. Their level up is primarily achieved by hitting and damaging NPCs and enemies, with an associated decrease in HP levels unless damage is evaded. In the case of gathering professions, tools such as Rod (Fishing), Gloves (Herbalism), Chisel (Carving), Pickaxe (Prospecting), and Arcane (Alchemy) are used. Leveling up in these professions is experience-based and often results in positive HP levels. It can also affect food and water levels depending on the profession.

**Tools**
  - All Tools provide a flat 30 defense regardless of item level
  - Tools need a relevant skill level (fishing, herbalism, prospecting, carving, alchemy) ≥ the item level to equip
  - Tools enable an agent to collect an associated resource (ration, poultice, scrap, shaving, shard) at a level equal to the item level

|

**Rations**
  - Consume rations to restore 5 food and water per item level
  - Requires at least one skill greater than or equal to the item level to use

    A rod is used to collect the rations. Alternatively, agents can buy rations in the market.
    
    For example, agents can harvest a level 3 fish only with a level 3 rod. If they buy a fish in the market, they can eat level 3 fish by just having any skill level 3 or above. If they buy a ration with a level higher than any of their skills, they can store but cannot eat it until a skill level = the ration level. 
 
|

**Poultices**
  - Consume to restore 5 health per gloves level.
  - Requires at least one skill greater than or equal to the glove level to use.
  
  The same rules about levels apply to poultices and rations. 


|icon| Market
*************

Gold coins are the currency for buying and selling items in NMMO. Gold coins cannot be sub-divided. Agents set their own prices and receive gold when someone is willing to accept their price. Within the same team, can gift to one another if they are standing on the same tile. 

Market interactions are as follows:
 - Agents place sell offers on the market for one of their items at a desired price
 - The item is immediately removed from the seller's inventory
 - Other agents can immediately buy that item and receive it
 - If multiple agents attempt to buy the same item at the same time, the market will attempt to fulfill the request from another seller at a price no more than 10% higher.

Agents only observe the current best offer for each item of each level. This bounds the observation and action spaces.

Gold is used in the game as a currency for buying and selling. Combat items like Axe, Pickaxe, Chisel, along with their corresponding ammunitions (Wood Arrows, Rock Whetstones, Magic Runes), weapons (Bow, Sword, Wand) and armors (Hat, Top, Bottom) can be traded with gold. Health items, including tools like Rod and Gloves, are also purchasable. The rod allows the player to harvest fish for ration items that restore food and water, while gloves enable herb harvesting to produce potion items that restore health.

|icon| NPCs
************

**Characteristics**
 - NPCs are controlled by one of three scripted AIs
 - Passive NPCs wander randomly and cannot attack
 - Neutral NPCs wander randomly but will attack aggressors and give chase using a Dijkstra's algorithm based pathing routine
 - Hostile NPCs will actively hunt down and attack other NPCs and players using the same pathing algorithm
 - NPCs will appear in varying levels

**NPC Items**
 - NPCs spawn with random armor piece
 - NPCs spawn with a random tool
 - Any equipment dropped will be of level equal to the NPC's level
 - NPCs spawn with gold equal to their level

Generally, Passive NPCs will spawn towards the edges of the map, Hostile NPCs spawn in the middle, and Neutral NPCs spawn somewhere between.

|icon| Tiles Quick Reference
******************************

Tile resources in the game serve distinct purposes and are obtained differently. For water tile resources, water can be drunk directly by standing next to a water tile, and fish can be harvested using a rod for ration items. Grass tile resources include food, which can be eaten by standing on a food tile, and herbs that can be harvested using gloves to increase health. Tree resources, harvested using an axe, can be used to boost the bow's damage in ranged combat. Stone tile resources comprise ore and crystals that are harvested using a pickaxe and chisel respectively. The ore boosts the sword's damage in melee combat, while crystals boost the wand's damage in magic combat. Finally, gold resources can be used to buy items from other players in the market, and they can be obtained by selling items or defeating NPCs.
