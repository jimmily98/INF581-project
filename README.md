# INF581-project

Ecole Polytechnique INF581 2023-2024 team project.



### Code Execution Method

Upload the NeuralMMO.ipynb to colab and execute.

To run this jupyter notebook, please ensure that the google drive is mounted.

The notebook will define a working directory and it will download the baseline code for Neural MMO environment.

For the first time to run, please uncomment the following two lines in the third code block

"# %mkdir $work_dir"

"%cd baselines"

For later runs, if the mounted google drive is the same and the baseline code exists, please comment the two lines.

The rest should be similar to the lab6 from INF581.
